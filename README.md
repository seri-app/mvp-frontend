# Seri

Front-end for Recommerce logistics app Seri.

Development Rules:
1. Git branch: #(issue-number)-task-description
2. Modular code: 
 - Compartmentalize your PR, each should only do one job (e.g. create a page/refactoring). Don't group multiple tasks into a bulk of code.
 - Good rule of thumb: limit each PR to 300 lines of code changes.
4. Each PR should be linked to an issue.
5. Clear description.
6. Adhere to [Flutter Style Guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo):
  - Lazy Progamming: "Write what you need and no more, but when you write it, do it right."
