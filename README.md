Front-end for Recommerce logistics app Seri.

Development Rules:
1. Git branch: #(issue-number)-task-description
2. Compartmentalize your PR. Each PR should only do one job (e.g. create a page/refactoring). Don't group multiple tasks into a bulk of code.
3. Each PR should be linked to an issue.
4. Clear description.
5. Adhere to [Flutter Style Guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo):
  - Lazy Progamming: "Write what you need and no more, but when you write it, do it right."
