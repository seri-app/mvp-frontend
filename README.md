Front-end for Recommerce logistics app Seri.

Development Rules:
1. Git branch: #(issue-number)-task-description
2. Compartmentalize your PR (each PR should be limited to <300 lines change), don't group them all into a bulk of code.
3. Each PR should be linked to an issue.
4. Clear description.
5. Adhere to [Flutter Style Guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo).
